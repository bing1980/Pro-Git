## Getting a Git Repository
You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:  
1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or  
2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.  
In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.
### Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory
Go to your project directory on your machine and type: **git init**  
This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files â€” a Git repository skeleton
