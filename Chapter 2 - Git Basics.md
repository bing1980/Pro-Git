## Getting a Git Repository
You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:  
1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or  
2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.  
In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.
### Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory
Go to your project directory on your machine and type: ***git init***  
This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files â€” a Git repository skeleton.  
If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few ***git add*** commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a ***git commit***:
* $ git add *.c
* $ git add LICENSE
* $ git commit -m 'initial project version'
### Cloning an Existing Repository
You clone a repository with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this:  
* $ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2  
If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than libgit2, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:  
* $ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit
### Recording Changes to the Repository
