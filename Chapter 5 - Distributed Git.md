## Distributed Workflows
In contrast with Centralized Version Control Systems **(CVCSs)**, the distributed nature of Git allows you to be far more flexible in how developers collaborate on projects. In centralized systems, every developer is a node working more or less equally with a central hub. In Git, however, every developer is potentially both a node and a hub.
