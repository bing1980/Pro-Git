## Version Control System (VCS)
  Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes 
over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

### Local Version Control Systems
  Programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all changes to files under revision control.

### Centrialized Version Control Systems
  Centrialized Version Control Systems(CVSs) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.
